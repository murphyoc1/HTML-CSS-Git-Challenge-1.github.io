To Horiseon staff,

Attached is re-optimized code to fit accessability standards. The changes made included a few minor changes but overall help with the operation and layout of the website.

# index.html

For index.html I started by adding a title "Horiseon Social Solution Services".

The buttons in the header were not properly linked so I went ahead nad made sure the id's throughout the page matched with the proper content call outs. A few <div> elements needed to be removed and re-arranged to make it easier to read the HTML. The links for images were verified to have relitive pathing as well as alt text for user help. A unused class was removed in the footer as well.

# style.css

For style.css I verified links used relative pathing for the hero. The benefits and content classes were simplified using the parent class to reduce the amount of styles we need to define.
